\chapter*{Assignment Text}\label{chap:assignment}

The objective of this master thesis is to work towards leveraging the Vortex soft Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to create an FPGA-accelerated evaluation infrastructure for GPUs at NTNUâ€™s Computer Architecture Lab. The starting point of the thesis is the (potential) performance issues that the candidate identified in Vortex during his project work by enabling Vortex to generate CPI stacks. In the master thesis, the candidate should propose, implement, and evaluate solutions to at least one of the (potential) performance issues. If time permits, the candidate should broaden the analysis by evaluating the observed problems and proposed solutions with benchmarks from commonly used GPU benchmark suites (e.g., Rodinia).
